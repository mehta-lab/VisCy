# Infection Classification Model

This repository contains the code for the infection classification model (`infection_classification_model.py`) used in the infection phenotyping project.

## Overview

The `infection_classification_model.py` file implements a machine learning model for classifying infections based on various features. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, either fluorescence or label-free images, and can be used to predict the infection type for new samples.
