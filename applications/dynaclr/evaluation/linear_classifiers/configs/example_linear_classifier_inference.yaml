# Example configuration for applying a trained linear classifier
#
# Usage:
#   dynaclr apply-linear-classifier \
#       -c evaluation/linear_classifiers/configs/example_linear_classifier_inference.yaml

# W&B project name where the model artifact is stored
wandb_project: DynaCLR-2D-linearclassifiers

# Name of the model artifact in W&B
# (e.g., linear-classifier-cell_death_state-phase)
model_name: linear-classifier-cell_death_state-phase

# Version of the model artifact
# Use 'latest' for the most recent version, or specific version like 'v0', 'v1'
version: latest

# W&B entity (username or team, null for default)
wandb_entity: null

# Path to embeddings zarr file for inference
embeddings_path: /path/to/embeddings.zarr

# Path to save output zarr file with predictions.
# When omitted (or null), predictions are written back to embeddings_path.
# output_path: /path/to/output_with_predictions.zarr

# Well prefixes to restrict predictions to (optional).
# When omitted, all cells are predicted. Cells in other wells get NaN.
# Useful for organelle-specific classifiers where different wells have different markers.
# include_wells:
#   - A/1
#   - A/2

# Whether to overwrite output if it already exists (only used when output_path is set)
overwrite: false
