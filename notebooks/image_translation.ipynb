    "## 1. Overview <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"overview\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "U-Net model consists of an encoder (downsampling) part and a decoder (upsampling) part. The U-Net model is immensely popular for many image analysis tasks. One of the key design feature of the U-Net architecture is the skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers, which allows the model to learn patterns at multiple spatial resolutions. U-Nets were orginally designed for image segmentation (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28). Using U-Nets for image translation (a regression problem) needs a few tweaks, such as: \n",
    "* changing the loss function, \n",
    "* changing the final activation layer, and \n",
    "* data normalization (more on that later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an overview of the 2D and 2.5D residual U-Net model architecture. The main differences from the original U-Net architecture are: \n",
    "1. we add short skip connection within each block (residual block) in addtion to the long skip connections in the original U-Net. \n",
    "2. The 2.5D model provides better translation accuracy than 2D model - it uses 3D stacks as input and predicts 2D output. \n",
    "\n",
    "![U-Net architecture](supp_modelarch_RGB.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2D model translates slice$\\rightarrow$slice, whereas 2.5D model translates stack$\\rightarrow$slice. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the architecture similar to above, but with same convolution instead of valid convolution.  Same convolution operation pads the input image so that the output image has the same size as the input image after convolution."

    "\n",
    "We will  be using three main modules of microDL for image translation: preprocessing, training and inference (see imports above).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is the preprocessing. We have some options like resizing, flatfield correction, creating masks, and tiling. The data we're working with is already background corrected so we can safely skip that part. We also don't need to resize the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would however like to create masks based on our target data. The reason for that is that we would like to avoid training on background only, that is empty or near empty tiles. A threshold we found reasonable is to make sure that our tiles contain 25% signal or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would also like to tile our images. The original image size (2048 x 2048 pixels) is too large to be able to fit into memory and similar structures reappear across the images. So we'd be much better off splitting the images into smalle pieces (tiles). A design consideration for convolution neural networks is the [receptive field](https://medium.com/mlreview/a-guide-to-receptive-field-arithmetic-for-convolutional-neural-networks-e0f514068807), which is the region of the input space a given feature is looking at. Given the size of our structures of interest and our network architecture, we use 256 x 256 pixel tiles. Also, training on smaller tiles allow us to use bigger batch size so the training converges faster."

    "You can try both by changing train_config['trainer']['loss']. The names in microDL for losses are mse_loss and mae_loss, respectively. You can also try other custom losses by using the loss function names [here](https://github.com/czbiohub/microDL/blob/master/micro_dl/train/losses.py), or any standard [Keras loss function](https://keras.io/losses/) by specifying the loss function name defined by Keras. \n",

    "##### Optimizer\n",
    "A good default choice of optimizer is Adam. You can read more about different deep learning optimizers [here](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/), and you can change the optimizer you'd like to use in your training by changing the variable train_config['trainer']['optimizer']['name'] to any of the Keras optimizers listed [here](https://keras.io/optimizers/).\n",

    "If the learning rate is too small your training might take a very long time to converge, and if it's too big it might not converge at all. It's worth trying some different values and see what happens with convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dropout\n",
    "Since we're working with a very small dataset in exploratory training, chances are that your network will overfit to your training data. It's worth exploring train_config['network']['dropout'] and to see if increasing those variables can reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Number of filters\n",
    "The number of filters in each layer of the model controls the model capacity. This parameter is train_config['network']['num_filters_per_block']. Too large model capacity can lead to overfitting and not necesssarily better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Augmentation\n",
    "The data is flipped and rotated randomly to diversify the training set and mitigate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
