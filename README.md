# VisCy

VisCy is a deep learning pipeline for training and deploying computer vision models for image-based phenotyping at single-cell resolution.

The following methods are being developed:

- Image translation
  - Robust virtual staining of landmark organelles
- Image classification
  - Supervised learning of of cell state (e.g. state of infection)
- Image representation learning
  - Self-supervised learning of the cell state and organelle phenotypes

VisCy is currently considered alpha software and is under active development.
Frequent breaking changes are expected.

## Virtual staining

A full illustration of the virtual staining pipeline can be found [here](docs/virtual_staining.md).
Below are some examples of virtually stained images (click to play videos).

### Reference

The virtual staining models and training protocols are reported in our recent [preprint on robust virtual staining](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.31.596901):

This package evolved from the [TensorFlow version of virtual staining pipeline](https://github.com/mehta-lab/microDL), which we reported in [this paper in 2020](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55502):

## Installation

1. We recommend using a new Conda/virtual environment.

    ```sh
    conda create --name viscy python=3.10
    # OR specify a custom path since the dependencies are large:
    # conda create --prefix /path/to/conda/envs/viscy python=3.10
    ```

2. Clone this repository and install with pip:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mehta-lab/VisCy.git
    # change to project root directory (parent folder of pyproject.toml)
    cd VisCy
    pip install .
    ```

    If evaluating virtually stained images for segmentation tasks,
    install additional dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install ".[metrics]"
    ```

    Visualizing the model architecture requires `visual` dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install ".[visual]"
    ```

3. Verify installation by accessing the CLI help message:

    ```sh
    viscy --help
    ```

For development installation, see [the contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The pipeline is built using the [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/index.html) framework.
The [iohub](https://github.com/czbiohub-sf/iohub) library is used
for reading and writing data in [OME-Zarr](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01326-w) format.

The full functionality is tested on Linux `x86_64` with NVIDIA Ampere GPUs (CUDA 12.4).
Some features (e.g. mixed precision and distributed training) may not be available with other setups,
see [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org) for details.
