# VisCy

VisCy (abbreviation of `vision` and `cyto`) is a deep learning pipeline for training and deploying computer vision models for image-based phenotyping at single-cell resolution.

This repository provides a pipeline for the following.

- Image translation
  - Robust virtual staining of landmark organelles
- Image classification
  - Supervised learning of of cell state (e.g. state of infection)
- Image representation learning
  - Self-supervised learning of the cell state and organelle phenotypes

> **Note:**  
> VisCy has been extensively tested for the image translation task. The code for other tasks is under active development. Frequent breaking changes are expected in the main branch as we unify the codebase for above tasks. If you are looking for a well-tested version for virtual staining, please use release `0.2.1` from PyPI.

### Reference

The virtual staining models and training protocols are reported in our recent [preprint on robust virtual staining](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.31.596901).

This package evolved from the [TensorFlow version of virtual staining pipeline](https://github.com/mehta-lab/microDL), which we reported in [this paper in 2020](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55502).

### Library of virtual staining (VS) models

The robust virtual staining models (i.e *VSCyto2D*, *VSCyto3D*, *VSNeuromast*), and fine-tuned models can be found [here](https://github.com/mehta-lab/VisCy/wiki/Library-of-virtual-staining-(VS)-Models)

### Pipeline

A full illustration of the virtual staining pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/mehta-lab/VisCy/blob/dde3e27482e58a30f7c202e56d89378031180c75/docs/virtual_staining.md).

## Image representation learning

We are currently developing self-supervised representation learning to map cell state dynamics in response to perturbations,
with focus on cell and organelle remodeling due to viral infection.

See our recent work on temporally regularized contrastive sampling method
for representation learning on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11281).

## Installation

1. We recommend using a new Conda/virtual environment.

    ```sh
    conda create --name viscy python=3.10
    # OR specify a custom path since the dependencies are large:
    # conda create --prefix /path/to/conda/envs/viscy python=3.10
    ```

2. Install a released version of VisCy from PyPI:

    ```sh
    pip install viscy
    ```

    If evaluating virtually stained images for segmentation tasks,
    install additional dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install "viscy[metrics]"
    ```

    Visualizing the model architecture requires `visual` dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install "viscy[visual]"
    ```

3. Verify installation by accessing the CLI help message:

    ```sh
    viscy --help
    ```

For development installation, see [the contributing guide](https://github.com/mehta-lab/VisCy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Additional Notes

The pipeline is built using the [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/index.html) framework.
The [iohub](https://github.com/czbiohub-sf/iohub) library is used
for reading and writing data in [OME-Zarr](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01326-w) format.

The full functionality is tested on Linux `x86_64` with NVIDIA Ampere GPUs (CUDA 12.4).
Some features (e.g. mixed precision and distributed training) may not be available with other setups,
see [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org) for details.
