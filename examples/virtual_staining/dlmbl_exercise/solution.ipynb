    "# Image translation (Virtual Staining)\n",
    "\n",
    "Written by Eduardo Hirata-Miyasaki, Ziwen Liu, and Shalin Mehta, CZ Biohub San Francisco\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will _virtually stain_ the nuclei and plasma membrane from the quantitative phase image (QPI), i.e., translate QPI images into fluoresence images of nuclei and plasma membranes.\n",
    "QPI encodes multiple cellular structures and virtual staining decomposes these structures. After the model is trained, one only needs to acquire label-free QPI data.\n",
    "This strategy solves the same problem as \"multi-spectral imaging\", but is more compatible with live cell imaging and high-throughput screening.\n",
    "Virtual staining is often a step towards multiple downstream analyses: segmentation, tracking, and cell state phenotyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will:\n",
    "- Train a model to predict the fluorescence images of nuclei and plasma membranes from QPI images\n",
    "- Make it robust to variations in imaging conditions using data augmentions\n",
    "- Segment the cells using Cellpose\n",
    "- Use regression and segmentation metrics to evalute the models\n",
    "- Visualize the image transform learned by the model\n",
    "- Understand the failure modes of the trained model\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Part 1: Train a virtual staining model\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Explore OME-Zarr using [iohub](https://czbiohub-sf.github.io/iohub/main/index.html)\n",
    "  and the high-content-screen (HCS) format.\n",
    "  - Use our `viscy.data.HCSDataloader()` dataloader and explore the  3 channel (phase, fluoresecence nuclei and cell membrane)\n",
    "  A549 cell dataset.\n",
    "  - Implement data augmentations [MONAI](https://monai.io/) to train a robust model to imaging parameters and conditions.\n",
    "  - Use tensorboard to log the augmentations, training and validation losses and batches\n",
    "  - Start the training of the UNeXt2 model to predict nuclei and membrane from phase images.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2:Evaluate the model to translate phase into fluorescence.\n",
    "  - Compare the performance of your trained model with the _VSCyto2D_ pre-trained model.\n",
    "  - Evaluate the model using pixel-level and instance-level metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 3: Visualize the image transforms learned by the model and explore the model's regime of validity\n",
    "  - Visualize the first 3 principal componets mapped to a color space in each encoder and decoder block.\n",
