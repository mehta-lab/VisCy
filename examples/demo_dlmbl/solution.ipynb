    "In this exercise, we will solve an image translation task to predict fluorescence images of nuclei and membrane markers from quantitative phase images of cells. In other words, we will _virtually stain_ the nuclei and membrane visible in the phase image. \n",

    "Here, the source domain is label-free microscopy (material density) and the target domain is fluorescence microscopy (fluorophore density). The goal is to learn a mapping from the source domain to the target domain. We will use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically, a U-Net model with residual connections to learn the mapping. The preprocessing, training, prediction, evaluation, and deployment steps are unified in a computer vision pipeline for single-cell analysis that we call [VisCy](https://github.com/mehta-lab/VisCy).\n",

    "Today, we will train a 2D image translation model using a 2D U-Net with residual connections. We will use a dataset of 301 fields of view (FOVs) of Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells, each FOV has 3 channels (phase, membrane, and nuclei). The cells were labeled with CRISPR editing. Intrestingly, not all cells during this experiment were labeled due to the stochastic nature of CRISPR editing. In such situations, virtual staining rescues missing labels.\n",
